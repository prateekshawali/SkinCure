This project aims to develop a web-based system for skin disease detection and information.

CURRENT FEATURES
Users can upload images of their skin conditions.
A machine learning model analyzes the image and suggests potential diseases.
Users can access information about the suggested diseases, including causes, symptoms, and home remedies (if applicable).
The system emphasizes that the results are for informational purposes only and recommend consulting a doctor for a proper diagnosis.


TECH STACKS
Backend: Python (possible frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Machine Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (possible pre-trained models: VGG16, Inception)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS.
Integration with doctor appointment booking systems (ensuring HIPAA compliance).
AI-powered chat interface for user interaction and report generation.
Machine learning model for disease severity detection (requires expanded dataset with severity annotations).
